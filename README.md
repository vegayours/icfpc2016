Some work for ICFPC 2016 (origami) by Aleksandr Likhanov (vegayours@gmail.com)

Mostly very basic infrastructure to fetch, visualize and push solutions
As I remember I was just able to solve some of them manually and push.
I probably had some basic solver to remap or even rotate origami, but I couldn't find it anymore.
I just abandoned the competition because it was not that fun for me this time :-).
